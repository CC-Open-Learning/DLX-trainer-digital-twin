# 7.07 Motive Power Circuits

## Trainer Board Digital Twin

`MPC-Trainer-Digital-Twin` is a sandbox-style environment which aims to provide a full-featured realistic simulation of the Trainer Board for the Motive Power Circuit program. 

The repository was forked in order to preserve the existing procedural labs contained in the [Motive-Power-Circuits](https://github.com/CC-Open-Learning/DLX-power-circuits) repository, while making the necessary changes to the underlying systems used by the trainer board.

See documentation in the [Confluence](https://github.com/CC-Open-Learning/DLX-confluence) repository.
